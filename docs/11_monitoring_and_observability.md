Monitoring and Observability Overview

Monitoring and observability are critical to maintaining the health, accuracy, and
reliability of the AirWatch MLOps pipeline. This document describes how model
performance, data quality, and drift are tracked and managed. Key Monitoring Components

1. Model Performance Monitoring

   Tracks key metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and prediction accuracy over time.

   Compares current model predictions with historical performance benchmarks.

   Alerts triggered if model degrades beyond thresholds.

1. Data Drift Detection

   Uses Evidently AI to analyze distribution shifts in incoming data compared to
   training data.

   Monitors feature distributions, statistics, and correlations.

   Generates automated drift reports in HTML format stored on S3.

1. Prediction Quality Checks

   Evaluates prediction consistency and compares actual vs predicted values when ground
   truth becomes available.

   Highlights anomalies and unexpected prediction patterns.

Reporting

```
Evidently reports generated periodically provide insights into data and model status.

Reports are stored in dedicated S3 monitoring buckets for access by stakeholders.

Visualization dashboards facilitate quick assessment of drift and performance trends.
```

Alerting and Notifications

```
Prefect flow failure notifications provide immediate awareness of pipeline errors.

Custom alerts on drift and performance degradation can be configured via monitoring tools.

Alerts can integrate with email, Slack, or other messaging platforms.
```

Logging and Audit Trails

```
Prefect logs all flow and task execution details.

MLflow records model training runs, parameters, and metrics.

AWS CloudTrail and S3 access logs track data access and changes for compliance.
```

Best Practices

```
Schedule monitoring flows to run immediately after batch predictions.

Investigate and retrain models promptly when drift or performance issues are detected.

Maintain versioned monitoring reports for historical comparisons.

Use monitoring insights to improve feature engineering and model design.
