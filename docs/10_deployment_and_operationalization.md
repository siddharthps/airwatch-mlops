Deployment and Operationalization Overview

This document outlines the deployment and operationalization strategy for the AirWatch
MLOps pipeline. It covers how the components are deployed, scheduled, and maintained to
ensure smooth production-grade performance. Deployment Components

1. Model Training & Selection

   Executed as scheduled Prefect flows.

   MLflow tracks experiments and stores model artifacts.

   Best model selected based on validation metrics and overfitting checks.

   Model artifacts stored securely on AWS S3 for access by inference pipelines.

1. Inference Pipeline

   Batch predictions run periodically using Prefect flows.

   Fetches fresh EPA AQS data, transforms it, and applies the selected model.

   Predictions saved back to S3 with versioned file names and timestamps.

1. Data Pipeline

   Data ingestion and transformation flows pull data from EPA APIs.

   Data stored in raw and processed formats on S3.

   Supports model retraining and inference with clean, validated datasets.

Scheduling and Orchestration

```
Prefect manages workflow orchestration, retries, logging, and notifications.

Flows can be scheduled using Prefect Cloud or self-hosted Prefect server.

Tasks include data fetching, transformation, model training, inference, and monitoring.

Failures trigger retries or alerts depending on severity.
```

Infrastructure & Environment

```
AWS S3 serves as the central data and artifact storage.

MLflow tracking server manages experiment metadata and model registry.

Environment variables configured securely through .env files and AWS IAM roles.

Docker containers (optional) can package flows and dependencies for consistency across environments.
```

Security Considerations

```
AWS IAM roles limit access to S3 buckets and resources.

API keys and secrets stored securely, not hardcoded.

Network policies restrict access to MLflow tracking and Prefect APIs.

Audit logging via Prefect and AWS CloudTrail for operational transparency.
```

Maintenance and Updates

```
Regular retraining schedules to refresh models with new data.

Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines enable code updates.

Automated tests verify pipeline integrity before production deployment.

Monitoring and alerting to catch failures or drift early.
```
