# Monitoring & Observability

## Overview

Monitoring and observability are critical components of the AirWatch MLOps pipeline to
ensure model reliability, detect data drift, and maintain prediction quality over time.

## Monitoring Components

### 1. Data Drift Detection

- Implemented using **Evidently AI** to detect statistical differences between training
  and inference data distributions.
- Automated reports highlight feature shifts and potential risks to model accuracy.
- Reports are generated periodically and saved to S3 for access and archival.

### 2. Model Performance Monitoring

- Tracks key regression metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) on validation and test datasets.
- Monitors prediction accuracy over time by comparing predicted vs actual PM2.5 values.
- Alerts configured to notify stakeholders when performance drops below thresholds.

### 3. Pipeline Health Monitoring

- Prefect provides workflow execution logs, success rates, and failure alerts.
- Logs capture errors during data ingestion, transformation, training, inference, and
  deployment.
- Enables quick diagnosis and recovery from pipeline issues.

## Reports & Dashboards

- **Evidently Reports:** Interactive HTML dashboards that visualize data drift, feature
  distributions, and model performance metrics.

- **MLflow UI:** Centralized view of experiment runs, hyperparameters, metrics, and
  artifact versions.

- Reports are stored in designated S3 buckets under `monitoring_reports/` with
  timestamps for versioning.

## Alerting

- Alerts configured based on:
  - Significant data drift detected by Evidently.
  - Model performance degradation.
  - Pipeline failures or retries exceeding thresholds.
- Notifications can be integrated with email, Slack, or other communication tools via
  Prefect or custom scripts.

## Best Practices

- Monitor key features used in model training to ensure data consistency.
- Schedule regular monitoring jobs aligned with inference frequency (e.g., weekly or
  monthly).
- Keep historical monitoring data for trend analysis and auditability.
- Automate remediation workflows where feasible (e.g., retraining on drift detection).

## Summary

The monitoring and observability framework provides transparency and confidence in the
deployed models and data pipelines. It enables proactive detection of issues, ensuring
sustained model performance and data quality.
