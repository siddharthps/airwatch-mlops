# Testing Strategy & CI/CD Integration

## Overview

Robust testing and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) are essential
for ensuring code quality, reliability, and smooth production updates. This document
outlines the testing framework, coverage, and CI/CD setup used in the AirWatch MLOps
pipeline.

## Testing Strategy

### Test Types

- **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions and classes for correctness, including data
  processing, model training logic, and API integrations.

- **Integration Tests:** Validate interactions between modules, such as data ingestion
  combined with transformation, or model loading and inference workflows.

- **End-to-End Tests:** Simulate full pipeline runs, from data ingestion through model
  inference and monitoring, to ensure overall system integrity.

- **Mocking AWS Services:** Use `moto` to mock AWS S3 interactions for reliable and
  isolated testing without incurring AWS costs or requiring real credentials.

### Tools and Frameworks

| Tool       | Purpose                                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **pytest** | Test running and assertions                     |
| **moto**   | Mocking AWS services (S3)                       |
| **Ruff**   | Linting and static code analysis                |
| **UV**     | Dependency management and environment isolation |

### Coverage

- Achieves 90%+ test coverage across all modules.
- Tests cover data ingestion, transformation, model training, inference, and monitoring
  logic.
- Tests validate both successful paths and error handling scenarios.

## CI/CD Integration

### Continuous Integration

- **Pipeline Triggers:** Runs on every pull request or push to the main branch.

- **Steps:**

  - Install dependencies via UV
  - Run linting and formatting checks with Ruff
  - Run all tests with pytest, including coverage report generation
  - Run security checks on dependencies

- **Reporting:** Test results and coverage reports are integrated into pull request
  comments or CI dashboards.

### Continuous Deployment

- **Artifact Management:** Model artifacts and Docker images (if applicable) are
  versioned and stored securely (e.g., AWS S3, container registry).

- **Automated Deployment:** On passing tests, deployment workflows trigger to update
  cloud infrastructure or MLflow registry with new models.

- **Rollback:** Enables easy rollback to previous model versions if monitoring detects
  issues post-deployment.

## Environment & Secrets Management

- Environment variables are managed through `.env` files and CI/CD secrets managers.
- AWS credentials and API keys are securely injected during pipeline runs.
- Sensitive data is never hardcoded or committed to source control.

______________________________________________________________________

## Best Practices

- Write tests concurrently with development for maximum coverage.
- Mock external dependencies to ensure tests run quickly and reliably.
- Automate all testing and deployment steps for repeatability and auditability.
- Monitor test flakiness and failures to maintain pipeline health.

## Summary

The AirWatch MLOps pipeline incorporates comprehensive testing and CI/CD automation to
ensure high code quality and reliable model delivery. This setup supports rapid
iteration and robust production operations.
