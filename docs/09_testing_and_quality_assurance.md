# Testing & Quality Assurance

## Overview

Robust testing and quality assurance ensure the reliability, maintainability, and correctness of the AirWatch MLOps pipeline components.

---

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests

- Focus on individual functions and methods to verify correctness.
- Examples include testing data transformations, API response handling, and model training steps.
- Implemented using **pytest** with extensive coverage across modules.

### 2. Integration Tests

- Test interactions between components such as data ingestion, transformation, and model training flows.
- Verify data flows correctly through the pipeline end-to-end.
- Use **Prefectâ€™s testing utilities** and mocks for external dependencies.

### 3. Mocking External Services

- Use **moto** library to mock AWS S3 interactions during testing.
- Mock API calls to the EPA AQS API to avoid external dependencies and control test scenarios.
- Isolate tests from network or cloud resource fluctuations.

### 4. Coverage and Quality Enforcement

- Achieve and maintain 90%+ test coverage to catch regressions early.
- Use **Ruff** for linting and enforcing PEP 8 style.
- Use **UV** for dependency management and environment consistency.

## Running Tests

- Run all tests with detailed verbosity using `pytest`.
- Generate coverage reports to identify untested areas.
- Run targeted tests for specific modules during development.

---

## Best Practices

- Write tests concurrently with feature development.
- Use fixtures to manage test data and mock setups.
- Continuously integrate testing in CI pipelines for automated validation.
- Regularly review and refactor tests for clarity and maintainability.

---

## Summary

Comprehensive testing and quality assurance provide confidence in pipeline stability, facilitate faster development, and minimize bugs in production.
